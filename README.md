Baheti, Department of computer Science , IIS (Deemed to be University) Changes in the ways in
which customers engage with an online channel, especially in terms of product pricing and delivery
models, have quickly advanced due to the rapid growth of e-commerce in India. Instamart, Blinkit
and Jiomart are the main competitors competing for customers. As the emotion and rationality of
understanding the determinants of consumer behaviour increasingly influence business strategy
and academic research. Price sensitivity and time of delivery are two overarching factors affecting
consumers in the competitive landscape of digital commerce as dynamic pricing and instant
delivery makes the traditional methods of how consumers purchase obsolete. Integrating this
backdrop with our research, the current study utilizes transaction-level datasets from leading Indian
e-commerce platforms to systematically examine how product price and delivery time influence
consumer choices. The dataset encompasses diverse variables, including product details,
categories, delivery times, ratings, and Feedback. Advanced analytical methods such as
exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, and predictive modelling are employed to assess how
these factors interact and differ across platforms and product categories. The research also
introduces novel feature engineering, such as delivery speed categorization and percentage
discount calculations, to enhance insight into consumer decision-making patterns. The objective of
this research paper is to measure both the relative importance of price and delivery time in
purchase likelihood on Instamart, Blinkit, and Jiomart, as well as to measure customers sensitivity
to price and delivery time by platform and category. Our findings should lead to practical
recommendations for e-commerce companies on how to structure their prices based on customer
delivery time and payment sensitivity. The objective of this research paper is to measure both the
